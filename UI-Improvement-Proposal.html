            <h2>Brief statement of problem</h2>

            <p>We decided to go with ebay.com and our reasoning behind it is its outdated aesthetic for first-time users.
            The webpage for buying an item seems cluttered. We thought that first-time users would have a difficult time navigating through the page on a specific item
            with an enormous amount of information thrown at them. We thought that the related items were important for the user to see as multiple sellers provide a 
            market where price is competitive and so it would be beneficial to display this information but in a more concise manner so as to not overwhelm the webpage. 
            We also thought that the logical flow of the webpage was considerably lacking and needed some optimization.On a mobile device such as a smartphone the website
            UI is much easier to navigate, cleaner, and simpler to understand. Opposed to the website on a desktop, which is much harder to navigate and cluttered. Based on this information we are hoping to base the desktop website on the mobile website to help the over aesthetic and flow of the desktop website.
