	In order to easily gather information, we created a Google form that was sent out to a small population of previously known people. The form includes the link to a specific eBay page that we used as an example, as well as various questions about what the user thought about the setup, how easy or difficult they found to navigate and understand the page, if they would change anything, ect. While there are some multiple choice questions, the majority of the questions left open to answer however the user pleases. This allows for participants to add whatever thoughts and details they want instead of limiting their responses to a specific set. Throughout the form we attempted to keep the questions neutral to not introduce our own bias to the users and let them form their own thoughts and opinions.
