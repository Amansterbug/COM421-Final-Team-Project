    <h2>Why we chose eBay and it's current issues</h2>

    <p>The website we are discussing is eBay.com, due to its cluttered and outdated aesthetic for first-time users. As a team our initial reaction to the site was 
        that it seemed overwhelming based on the placement of many boxes within the site. We thought that first-time users would have a difficult time navigating 
        through the page on a specific item with an enormous amount of information thrown at them. We thought that the related items were important for the user to 
        see as multiple sellers provide a market where price is competitive and so it would be beneficial to display this information but in a more concise manner 
        so as to not overwhelm the webpage. We also thought that the logical flow of the webpage was considerably lacking and needed some optimization. </p>

<p>An issue we experienced during our audit was that many of our users saw the website through their mobile phone changing the aesthetics of the site to a more 
    functional one. Because of this our group decided to base some of the functionality on the mobile website to make the site as a whole more cohesive and user 
    friendly.</p>

        <p>An issues we noticed included the recently viewed item bar. It is advertised at least 4 times on the site. In the photos
            you can see a few of the recently viewed bars from the site page; this causes visual clutter, which was one of the biggest issues our audience experienced with the site.
