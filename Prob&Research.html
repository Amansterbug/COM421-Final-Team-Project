    <h2>Why we chose eBay and it's current issues</h2>

    <p>The website we are discussing is eBay.com, due to its cluttered and outdated aesthetic for first-time users. As a team our initial reaction to the site was 
        that it seemed difficult time navigating through the page on a specific item with an enormous amount of content thrown at them.
          Some other main issues included:
        <ul>
            <li>overwhelming amounts of information based on the placement of many boxes within the site.</li>
            <li>it would be beneficial to display this information but in a more concise manner 
                so as to not overwhelm the webpage.</li>
                <li>The logical flow of the webpage was considerably lacking and needed some optimization.</li>
        </ul>   </p>

<p>An issue we experienced during our audit was that many of our users saw the website through their mobile phone changing the aesthetics of the site to a more 
    functional one. Because of this our group decided to base some of the functionality on the mobile website to make the site as a whole more cohesive and user 
    friendly.</p>

        <p>An issue we noticed included the recently viewed item bar. It is advertised at least 4 times on the site. In the photos
            you can see a few of the recently viewed bars from the site page; this causes visual clutter, which was one of the biggest issues our audience experienced with the site.

            <p>Other issues we encountered were the disproportions of the site. As you can see
                from the images the main task bar was considerably smaller to the rest of the site. It also
                was slightly difficult to click the items on, which is not accomodating to those with hand mobility issues.
            The main part of the site with the headphones is cluttered as well. 
        The side bar does a nice job of organizing the site, but the shipping/delivery portion does 
    the opposite. It would be better to have this information on the checkout portion of the site or in a side bar to mimic the aesthetic of the current one </p>
