        To address the concerns raised in the surveys and create a more appealing and streamlined look for eBay's website, 
        we propose a redesign that focuses on reducing clutter and enhancing user experience. Out of the 18 responses received,
            7 expressed issues with the amount of information on the page, citing it as too much or cluttered. Our goal is to adopt 
            a cleaner look, emphasizing key elements that contribute to a more user-friendly interface.

            The first issue that we wanted to denote was the difference in not only font but also size between the text in the 
            header and the rest of the page. Below you can see the difference between the two which is quite substantial as it catches the eye quite easily.
