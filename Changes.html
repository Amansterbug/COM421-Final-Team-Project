        To address the concerns raised in the surveys and create a more appealing and streamlined look for eBay's website, 
        we propose a redesign that focuses on reducing clutter and enhancing user experience. Out of the 18 responses received,
            7 expressed issues with the amount of information on the page, citing it as too much or cluttered. Our goal is to adopt 
            a cleaner look, emphasizing key elements that contribute to a more user-friendly interface.

            <h2>Issues and Suggestions</h2>
            <h3>1. Header Differences</h3>
            <p>The first issue that we wanted to denote was the difference in not only font but also size between the text in the 
            header and the rest of the page. Below you can see the difference between the two which is quite substantial as it catches the eye quite easily.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our suggestion for this issue would to have a single style of font used throughout the webpage and add a
                 divider between the header and the rest of page so that the separation between
                the header and body is noticable yet through means that do not difference in appearance such as different fonts and sizes.
                This would be a beneficial change because it would had unification to the webpage and allow first-time-buyers to be distracted by the differences
                between the header and the rest of webpage. Facilitating a more targeted approach to the product and increasing the chance of a purchase.

            <h3>2. "Also Viewed" Section Placement</h3>
            <p>
                The second issue that we looked at was the placement of the list of "Also Viewed" items. It appears on the webpage as the first item right after the header. 9 out 18 responses on our survey
                mentioned the placement of of such lists as it took away from the actual product that the customer would view on the webpage.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./ImagesIdrees/AlsoViewedBanner.png" style="width: 100%;">
            </figure>
            <p>
                Our suggestion for this issue would be to move this list down to where the other list are ("Similar Sponsored Items", "Sponsored items customers also bought", "You may also like", etc.). 
                As it is given that we want to allow the first-time-buyer to have smooth experience while searching for products, it only seems obvious that the lists containing other/similar items to be at the 
                end of the page, grouped together. This would be a beneficial change as it would give the page a less "cluttered" look as the responses stated in our survey and appeal to users better. It would also be less
                distracting for first-time-buyers as the main focus right as the webpage opens would be the product with less relevant items listed at the bottom of the page.
