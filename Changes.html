        To address the concerns raised in the surveys and create a more appealing and streamlined look for eBay's website, 
        we propose a redesign that focuses on reducing clutter and enhancing user experience. Out of the 18 responses received,
            7 expressed issues with the amount of information on the page, citing it as too much or cluttered. Our goal is to adopt 
            a cleaner look, emphasizing key elements that contribute to a more user-friendly interface.

            <h3>1. Header Differences</h3>
            <p>The first issue that we wanted to denote was the difference in not only font but also size between the text in the 
            header and the rest of the page. Below you can see the difference between the two which is quite substantial as it catches the eye quite easily.
            </p>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Our suggestion for this issue would to have a single style of font used throughout the webpage and add a
                 divider between the header and the rest of page so that the separation between
                the header and body is noticable yet through means that do not difference in appearance such as different fonts and sizes.
                This would be a beneficial change because it would had unification to the webpage and allow first-time-buyers to be distracted by the differences
                between the header and the rest of webpage. Facilitating a more targeted approach to the product and increasing the chance of a purchase.

            <h3>2. "Also Viewed" Section Placement</h3>
            <p>
                The second issue that we looked at was the placement of the list of "Also Viewed" items. It appears on the webpage as the first item right after the header. 9 out 18 responses on our survey
                mentioned the placement of of such lists as it took away from the actual product that the customer would view on the webpage.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./ImagesIdrees/AlsoViewedBanner.png" alt="Top of the webpage with header and also viewed list included">
                <figcaption>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Our suggestion for this issue would be to move this list down to where the other list are ("Similar Sponsored Items", "Sponsored items customers also bought", "You may also like", etc.). 
                As it is given that we want to allow the first-time-buyer to have smooth experience while searching for products, it only seems obvious that the lists containing other/similar items to be at the 
                end of the page, grouped together. This would be a beneficial change as it would give the page a less "cluttered" look as the responses stated in our survey and appeal to users better. It would also be less
                distracting for first-time-buyers as the main focus right as the webpage opens would be the product with less relevant items listed at the bottom of the page.

            <h3>3. Reviews</h3>
            <p>
                The third issue we identified was the absence of reviews on the intital product listing. Below you can see there is no clear section dedicated to reviews. (No "Star" rating system).
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./ImagesIdrees/ReviewsP1.png" alt="Product page with information about product, shipping, and purchasing">
                <figcaption>
                    Figure 3: Product Detail/Information Page. (Reviews Missing)
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Most online stores include a review system that is easily accessible immediately to shopper as that is a important feature used by buyer when shopping online. Our suggestion would be to replace the 
                "Shop with confidence" section with a section that displays the rating of the product as well as small snippet from the written reviews by other customers. We want to note here that there is a Reviews section
                on the page, however it is only seen once you scroll to the bottom of page. As seen below.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./ImagesIdrees/ReviewsP2.png" alt="review section of product from other customers near the bottom of the page">
                <figcaption>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                This would be a beneficial change as reviews are a key feature that customers, whether first-time or recurring, look at when deciding on a purchase. We think that that information should be immediately apparent 
                to the user as to allow for ease of use and give the necessary information the user as soon as the webpage is opened.
