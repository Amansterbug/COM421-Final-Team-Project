    <p>In our survey, we ended up with 18 responses. We updated some of our questions, and as a result, our question regarding the method of viewing had only 7 responses. According to our first question, 57.1% of respondents used a phone to look at the eBay website. </p>

    <p>This leads to the first limitation of our survey, and the first change we would make in the future. The mobile website for eBay is much more usable than the desktop version. Much of the clutter seen on the desktop webpage is not visible on the mobile webpage. This could be one of the reasons why we saw a much higher percentage of satisfaction than we expected.</p>

        <figcaption>Results for "Do you like the aesthetics of this page?"</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>As seen in the chart, 72.2% of the respondents liked the aesthetics of the page, which is much higher than expected. Despite this, there was still good feedback regarding what this webpage could change. Some of the most common feedback was:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The website could use more information and photos of the product</li>
        <li>There were too many similar product sections, and the one at the top of the page was specifically distracting</li>
        <li>Many of the sections on the page were extremely wordy and could benefit from less clutter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite this feedback, most thought that this page was easy to navigate.</p>

        <figcaption>Results for "Was the product page easy to navigate?"</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <P>When it came to the sections on the page, this question was more split. 44.4% of respondents thought that some of the sections were too much for the site. </P>

        <figcaption>Results for "Did any section seem too much for the site page?"</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Once again, many of the respondents believed that the similar product tabs were poorly placed. Many thought the similar product bar on the top of the page took away from the item they were trying to purchase. There were also too many of them across the page, and the site could benefit from less.</p>
    <p>In the end, 77.8% of respondents said they would buy another product on eBay based on the web design.</p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>If we were to run this survey again, we would change a few things. Mainly, we would have implemented the question regarding which device a user was using earlier. This is extremely important, and without knowing which device the users were on, we would have no clue which web page they were looking at. </p>
    <p>Also, if possible, we would make sure that as many respondents as possible used the desktop page. This project is centered around the desktop page, and having results from the mobile site does not benefit us as much. While there still is plenty to learn from the mobile site, much of the feedback we wanted was regarding the desktop site.</p>
